## Multi-Language Support

Currently I have gotten the dynamic switching of the browser display language working. The next step would be to devise a workflow to handle a dossier relevant language workflow. The dossier language need not be the same as the users viewing language. I could have a german GUI, but my order is in english and chinese, with english being the default language for the order.

## Access rights and security

TODO: implement https://atmospherejs.com/ongoworks/security in order to handle access rights for collections

TODO: need to think of a solution how to implement security similar to the current app in it's granularity. No current package solutions for security come even close to the fine grained rights management in Agent Online, or I do not understand how to map the current packages feature set to our requirements yet.
